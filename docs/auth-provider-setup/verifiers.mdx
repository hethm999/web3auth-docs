#### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

There are two types of `Verifiers` at Web3Auth:

1. `Default Verifiers`: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc.) which are owned and managed by
   Web3Auth's account.
2. `Custom Verifiers`: If you want to manage your OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc.) yourself or to use some Federated Identity Providers
   like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, Okta etc., or even your Custom JWT Authentication, you'll need to create a verifier under a project on the
   Web3Auth's dashboard.

For users to be able to log in using your custom authentication flow, you will need to use a Custom Verifier. The Wallet that is generated for each
user is specific to a verifier. Verifier scripts determine the access structure to your users' wallets, and the set of Verifier scripts you choose
will determine which logins your application will ultimately use.

You can read more about verifiers [in this blog post](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612) or
[in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Web3Auth/discussions/427#discussioncomment-3442052).

The `Custom Authentication` tab of a project looks something like this:

## Create Verifier

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. You'll need this while initializing the `Web3Auth`/`Web3AuthNoModal` SDK for setting up the custom authentication.

### Choose a Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the provided options.

The following is the list we have on our Dashboard:

1. Social Login Providers
   - [Google](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/google)
   - [Facebook](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/facebook)
   - [Twitch](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/twitch)
   - [Discord](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/discord)
2. Custom Providers
   - [Auth0](/auth-provider-setup/federated-identity-providers#auth0)
   - [Custom JWT](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-providers)
3. Aggregate Multiple Providers
   - [Aggregate Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier)

If something you're looking for is not available in the list, choose `Custom Provider` and provide the JWT details.

### Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list above is only comprehensive to some of the logins our system can support. If you'd like support for a particular login system, send your
query to hello@web3auth.io.

## Edit Verifier

If you have created a verifier under your project, you'll see it under the custom authentication tab.

Click on the three dots next to the verifier you wish to edit and click on `Update Verifier` in the dropdown.

![Verifier Options](/images/dashboard/edit-verifier.png)

The `Edit Verifier` modal will appear. Make the necessary changes and click on save at the bottom right.

## Aggregate Verifiers

Developers can create `Aggregate Verifiers` from the Web3Auth Dashboard. Combining multiple login methods to create a verifier to get the same address
for your user regardless of their login providers is possible while creating a verifier, for example, combining a `Google` and `Email Passwordless`
login or `Google` and `GitHub` via Auth0 to access the same key for your user. These login methods should share the same Verifier ID, e.g., `email`;
Such verifiers are called `Single ID Verifiers`.

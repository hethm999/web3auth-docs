Auth Provider setup refers to the capability of creating a verifier with Web3Auth. We recommend you set a verifier to use the Custom Authentication
feature of Web3Auth.

## Supported Auth Providers

### Social

<SocialTiles />

### Federated / Identity Providers

<FederatedTiles />

### Bring your own Custom Login Providers

:::info

For Custom JWT-based authentication services, you need to use the [`Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/), since the Web3Auth
Modal will only help you configure the social logins present within the Modal UI.

There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/web3auth) or simply
post your query on the [Community Forum](https://web3auth.io/community) and we will take care of things from there.

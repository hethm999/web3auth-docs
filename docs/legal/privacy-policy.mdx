This privacy policy is applicable to Web3Auth's Products (https://app.openlogin.com), Torus wallet (https://app.tor.us).

## Mode and Place of Processing the Data

### Methods of Processing

The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data whilst on the users client-side. The
Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes
indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
Owner's \(administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration\) or external parties \(such as third-party technical service providers,
mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies\) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list
of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.

### Legal Basis of Processing

The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:

- Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data
  until the User objects to such processing \(“opt-out”\), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however,
  does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
- provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
- processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
- processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
- processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

### Place

The Data is processed Owner's software on user devices. There is no user specific data that is processed on servers that can identify the user.

The users' Anonymized Usage Data is processed on the Owner's offices and premises as well as cloud setups managed by the Owner.

Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization
governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to
safeguard their Data.

### Retention Time

Anonymized Usage Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.

Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Anonymized Usage Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of
a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

Once the retention period expires, Anonymized Usage Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification
and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

## The Purposes of Processing

The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Services, as well as for the following purposes: Analytics, Tag
Management, Registration and authentication, Displaying content from external platforms and Traffic optimization and distribution.

of service might still collect web traffic data for the pages where the service is installed, even when Users do not use it.

### Registration and Authentication

By registering or authenticating, Users allow Web3Auth to identify them and give them access to dedicated services. Depending on what is described

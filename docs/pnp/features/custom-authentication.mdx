Custom Authentication is the ability to integrate your own authentication flow with Web3Auth. We suggest using Custom Authentication instead of
relying on Web3Auth's default authentication Modal.

The benefits of using Custom Authentication are:

- It provides a comprehensive user experience from beginning to end.
- You can customize the data required from the authentication service and onboard users according to your specific needs.
- You can seamlessly migrate your existing users to the new authentication flow with Web3Auth, without requiring them to create new accounts.

## Supported Login Providers

### Social

<SocialTiles />

### Federated / Identity Providers

<FederatedTiles />

### Bring your own Custom Login Providers

:::info

For Custom JWT based authentication services, you need to use the [`Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/), since the Web3Auth
Modal will only help you configure the social logins present within the Modal UI.

## FAQs

:::tip

**Here are a couple of FAQs that might help you:**

- **Which logins should my application support?**

  - You can select from [this list](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers#supported-logins) or use your own custom authentication. There are some nuances
    with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

- **Should different logins lead to the same key?**

  - You can choose to connect logins with the same `Verifier ID`. For example if a user uses generic email logins and a gmail login to login on
    different occasions he/she can still retrieve the same key. This can only be done on logins which share a common unique identifier for a user.

    Read more about aggregating logins [here](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers#aggregating-loginsverifiers).

- **Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?**

  - Yes, If you'd like support for a particular login system do send your query over to hello@web3auth.io
  - If you have any questions, please get in touch with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/web3auth) or create a
    [GitHub Discussion](https://web3auth.io/discussions).
  - We'll be happy to help you out!

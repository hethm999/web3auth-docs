The Web3Auth [Unity SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unity-sdk) is a client-side library that allows you to authenticate users using Web3Auth
on `Unity3D` game engine. This SDK has been written majorly in `C#` and can be integrated preferably across all mobile platforms. It returns a private
key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This authentication can be achieved by using any social login options that
Web3Auth supports or uses a custom authentication flow of your choice.

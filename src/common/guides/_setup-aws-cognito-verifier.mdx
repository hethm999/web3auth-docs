Create a AWS Cognito **Verifier** from the **Custom Authentication** tab of your Web3Auth Project.

- Click on the `Custom Authentication` tab of your [Web3Auth Project](/dashboard-setup/projects-and-analytics#create-a-new-project).
- Click on the `Create Verifier` button.
- Enter a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. w3a-cognito-demo`
- Select `Custom Providers` from **Choose a Login Provider** section.

- **JWKS Endpoint**: Enter `https://cognito-idp.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{USER_POOL_ID}/.well-known/jwks.json` as the JWKS endpoint for the Cognito.
- Now you have the option to paste a sample idToken(JWT) to get the fields for the JWT validation. This step is optional, but if you have a sample JWT
  you can paste it here to get the fields for the JWT validation. You can also skip this step and fill in the fields manually.
- The following are the JWT validation fields needed for the Cognito JWT validation:

  - Type `iss` as a field and `https://cognito-idp.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{USER_POOL_ID}` as a value.
  - Next, type `aud` as a field and `APP_CLIENT_ID` as a value.

  _**Note: Replace the `REGION`, `USER_POOL_ID` and `APP_CLIENT_ID` with your Cognito specific details.**_

- Next, Select `Sub`, `Email` or a `Custom` value from the dropdown for the **JWT Verifier ID**. This is the field that will be used as the verifier
  ID for the user, and it has to be unique for each user.
- Finally, Click on the `Create` button to create your verifier.

It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy the verifier on _sapphire_devnet_. You'll receive an email once it's complete.

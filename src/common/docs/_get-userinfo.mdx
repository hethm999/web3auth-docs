After logging in, the Web3Auth instance will provide you with information regarding the user that is logged in. This information is obtained directly
from the JWT token and is not stored by Web3Auth. Therefore, this information can only be accessed through social logins after the user has logged
into your application.

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo(); // web3auth instance
```

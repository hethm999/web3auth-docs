For Connecting to Blockchain and making RPC calls within your dApp, you can use the `IProvider` instance returned while logging in the user. This
instance gives you the respective provider for your selection of blockchain. This provider can be used to interact with the connected chain using
exposed functions within the provider.

Web3Auth is chain agnostic, ie. be it any chain you're connecting to, you can use Web3Auth to connect to it. You can use the `EVM` or `Solana`
provider, that contain the native functions to connect to the blockchain or use the private key directly to connecting to the respective blockchain.

Currently web3auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains, one can easily get the private key from the base provider from
Web3Auth.

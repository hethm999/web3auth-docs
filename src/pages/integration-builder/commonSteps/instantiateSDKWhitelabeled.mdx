title: Create the Web3Auth instance
---

It's time to create an instance of Web3Auth in the project.

We need `clientId` and `chainConfig` to initialize `web3auth` object. Ideally, mentioning the `web3AuthNetwork` here will be a good practice, as it
helps you get ready for production deployment.

- You can get your `clientId` from registering (above) on the Developer Dashboard.
- `chainConfig` signifies the type of chain you want to initialize Web3Auth with, which will depend on the blockchain you've selected here.

  :::info connect any chain

  Please go through the [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/) Documentation, which contains all the details of the respective blockchain you have
  selected here.

  :::

- `web3AuthNetwork` signifies the network on which the deployed Web3Auth nodes are running. For testing purposes, we have a `testnet` network. For
  production usage, you can use the `cyan`, `mainnet`, & `aqua` networks.

  :::danger

  Please don't use the `testnet` network for production usage. You may end up losing user keys.

- For customising the UI for your modal, you can pass on the `uiConfig` parameter to the `Web3Auth` constructor. Know more about

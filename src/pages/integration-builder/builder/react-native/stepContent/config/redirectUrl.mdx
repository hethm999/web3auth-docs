title: Construct your redirectUrl
---

- Your `redirectUrl` is your defined `scheme` in Android, following some identifier of your choice. For example, if your `scheme` is
  `web3authrnexample`, you can define your `redirectUrl` as `web3authrnexample://openlogin`.

      ```tsx
      const scheme = "web3authrnexample"; // Or your desired app redirection scheme
      const resolvedRedirectUrl = `${scheme}://openlogin`;
      ```

- For iOS, you don't need to add `redirectUrl` as a iOS Custom URL Scheme, however, you may can add it to your `Info.plist`, but it is not required.

:::warning

Make sure you register this redirectUrl in the Web3Auth Developer Dashboard.
